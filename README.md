## Issue Encountered

While setting up the Django project, I encountered an issue when trying to run the command:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Despite multiple troubleshooting attempts, I was unable to resolve the problem.

## Solution

As a workaround, I manually wrote all the necessary project files using Visual Studio Code. This approach allowed me to proceed with the development of the project.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you for your understanding and support.
